## FOOD WEBSITE!

My project is a healthy food delivery website, rather than a fast food delivery website. The business offers private memberships to busy individuals, 
in order to supply them their daily healthy meals directly to their doorstep.


## UX!

My website has a "mobile first approach", so therefore perfect for the busy individual. Smart phone users will be very satisfied when they approach the website, 
as they can clearly view the various membership packages available, weekly menu options, our business locations and various methods of contact, so that potential customers can sign up hassle free with us. 
We have an option available where smart phone users can download our "APP" for a even better user experience.


## FEATURES!

My website called "EAT RIGHT!" has various features implemented in it. I have used many visuals like images of food, ingredients and cities, also videos of the services and facilities available for the customers.
I have provided a "About Us and Testimonials Section" to build customer trust and reassure them that they have come to the right place!
A feedback form is also provided for existing customers to give their feedback, so the business can keep on improving itself. Various contact and social media connection options are provided aswell, 
including a "Call Back" request form on the last page of the website.

Features left to implement would be the use of the actual "APP" element. Some buttons can lead to actual pages, for example "sign in page", "our membership options page" and "social media linked pages".


## TECHNOLOGIES USED!

I have used cloud9 code editor, html 5, css3, bootstrap version 3.3.7, github and google chrome.
This project mainly uses inbuilt javascript, jquery and css provided by bootstrap.
Css color options, html tags and form layouts have been sourced from w3schools.com, further customised css styling has been sourced from the course material provided by "Code Institute".


## TESTING!

I have tested the website on various screen sizes and browsers. This website works well on small screens and larger screens. Currently this website doesn't allow the use of all the "buttons", 
for example the "our membership packages", "sign in", "App store" and "social media links" buttons dont lead anywhere. The internal pages are linked very well together, 
so that the user can visit all five pages of the website flawlessly, in order to easily sign up with us.


## DEPLOYMENT!
